# purdue-senior-design

This is my repo that houses all of the files I used for the Great Oko's classes ABE 557 and ABE 558. I cannot garauntee that anything is "correct" or recieved a good grade. I did try my hardest - but I did get a B. And ya boy got a few low scores on a few homeworks, so I'd take everything here with a grain of salt - especially ABE 558, since I was very busy with another helping out with another class during that time *cough* ABE 301 *cough*

## Folder Layout

It is basically split into semester one (557) and semester two (558). You'll notice that semester one is much more dense - probably beacuse there was a lot more homowork and many more design problems.

The second semester was much more senior design and economics. Less homework, so probably less useful.

Please enjoy and try not to stress too much - everyone gets a B anyways  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
